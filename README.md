## Week 2 HW - Portfolio Page

For this week's homework assignment, I created a personal portfolio page to showcase my work, skills, and contact information.

I started off by creating a basic HTML page, using semantic HTML where possible. I then added links and images. I do not have any real projects to display yet so instead I created a mock up of three fake projects.

Next, I added some CSS to style the page in a way that looked pleasing to me. Lastly, I worked with media queries in CSS to make the webpage responsive. I formatted the webpage for a couple common screen sizes or breakpoints, including an iphone 8, iphone x, ipad, various android devices and monitors.

It is still a work in progress, but I can't wait to keep adding to it with real projects down the road!
